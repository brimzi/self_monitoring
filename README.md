# self_monitoring
Self organising protocol for sensors(simulated smart meters) that allows the devices to watch over the neighbours and report to the coordinator if some activity of interest(e.g failure) happens on the neighbour. This was part of a school project in Smart Grids(DAT300). Omnet++ was used for development and simulation. Something to note is in this implementation a modified version of the ICMP protocol implemetation was used hence the Omnet++'s inet directory has been included
This should be run as an app in Omnet++
